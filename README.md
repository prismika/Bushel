Bushel, the Barely Usable SHELl
Bushel is a Linux shell with minimal support for anything useful.
Is this a perfect shell? No. Does it have tab completion? No. Command history? No.

But is this a bug-free, dependable shell that will get the job done and always have your back?
Also no.

# Compilation Instructions
Simply type 'make'. If you have make installed, you're done!
If that was so fun you want to do it again, type 'make clean' and then 'make' again. Go to town!

# Known Bugs
1) The 'pause' command should suspend the shell, but instead it does nothing at all.
2) Output is sometimes converted to powerpoint before displaying.
3) Belittles you for unnecessary use of blockchain.
4) Emits radiation when compiled on TempleOS.
